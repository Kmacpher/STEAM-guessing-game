## Introduction to the Guessing Game Project

Greetings!

You are embarking on the beginning of your programming journey. How exciting! In this workhsop, you will be creating a Guessing Game. This game has simple rules:

  - A number between 1-100 will be randomly generated and is the winning number.
  - The player inputs their guess in a text input field and then submits their guess.
  - If the number they submitted is the winning number, they win! Otherwise, they are allowed to try again.
  - The game should give the player a hint after each guess, helping them know whether to guess lower or higher, and how close they are.
  - After 5 unsuccessful guesses, the game is over and the player loses.

Take a moment to open up and study [the finished product]().

While simple, there's A LOT of logic that you must figure out before the game will work. Games can be deceptively difficult. Additionally, we want to make sure our game is also visually pleasing to our player! We are not using any special tools or frameworks in this workshop--that meanst this game will be made FROM SCRATCH, which will give you an introduction to the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To get started, download the starting code from [this link]().
