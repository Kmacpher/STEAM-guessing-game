- Link to slides: https://slides.com/karenmacpherson/how-do-we-make-a-game

### Instructor Lesson Plan - topics to cover
_More instructions for each topic can be found in the presenter notes in the slides_

#### Lecture/Labs

1. Brief introduction to Browsers and the Web
2. Building blocks of making a web application/game
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - How do these three technologies work together at a high level?
3. HTML
    - Some HTML syntax (headers, divs, lists)
    - 10 min LIVE CODE
      - Create an html document
      - add a header to the body
      - open the document in the browser
      - add another element and refresh browser
      - have the students experiment on their own machines for 5 min
4. CSS
    - cover tags, ids, and classes
    - 10 min LIVE CODE
      - Add background color/image using the body tag
      - add color or center a header using an id
      - something using a class
      - connect css to html using the link tag
5. JavaScript
    - There's no way we can cover much javascript. This is really just an introduction to programming at a high level.
    - Biggest topics for this project will be
      - if else
      - functions (using them, not defining them)
6. Introduce workshop
    - Show the final product (open from `solution` branch) and walk through the functionality
    - Show the files they will be using, along with the workshop text.
    - Walk through at a high level the functions that they can use in `game.js`, and where they will write their code
    - If there is time, you can pseudocode out the checkGuess function with them (there is a flowchart in the slides and workshop)
    - All solutions are given to them as they go through the workshop, so they can continue at home.

#### Workshop

- Students will:
    - Add ids and classes to html elements to add styles from the premade CSS file
    - Fill out the `checkGuess` function with the game behavior. This includes calling pre-made functions and using if else conditional logic

#### After the workshop

If students would like to keep their work, they can email themselves their files. If they finish, and want the finished product to show off--they can email the files also to their instructor, who can create a github repo and host to Github Pages.
